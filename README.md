**Programmer:** Marco Gutierrez

This [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mgutierrezc/twitter_scraper_congress_peru/blob/master/Scraper%20for%20congress%20data.ipynb) uses `python-twitter` and `ntlk` packages to scrap the possible twitter accounts of peruvian congressmen and find the best match based on common ngrams for people involved in politics.
